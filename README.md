# iRDPG for Quantitative Trading on Stock Index Futures
## Requirement

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.4.0

## Run training or test case

1. `python main_train.py`
2. `python main_test.py`


## Module Description
- [main.py](main.py)
  -  run this file for training or testing, and it contains all the important hyperparameters.
- [rdpg.py](rdpt.py)
  -  The main body code for iRDPG, and it integrates other modules to run the whole algorithm.
- [agent.py](agent.py)
  -  Some operations for agent, such as create the actor-critic class, select actions, and save-load model weights.
- [model.py](model.py)
  -  Build the gru layer, actor, and critic.
- [evaluator.py](evaluator.py)
  -  Use the trained agent to test the trading performance.
- [PER_memory.py](replay_memory.py)
  -  Implementation for prioritied experience replay (PER).
- [environment.py](environment.py)
  -  The simulated environment for agent trading on China index futures and generating demostrations.
