\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
Please provide succinct concluding remarks for your report. You may discuss the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The potential future research directions
    \item Any technical limitations
    \item Any latest results on the problem of interest
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consistent Conclusions with the Original Paper}
1. Imitation learning techniques is successfully introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation of the trading agent.\\
2. The iRDPG suggests that the trading agent can benefit from experiences of classical trading strategies such as Dual Thrust Strategy.\\
3. The profitability and ability to resist risks of iRDPG were verified.\\
4. Comparison experiments provided its generalizability for different financial markets.\\


\subsection{Technical Limitation and Possible Future works}
Although the iRDPG agent can finally learn better policies than expert, this framework still needs well performed demonstrations in the early training stage. Therefore, in the future, maybe it can try other technique such as "policy optimization from demonstration (POfD)" (\cite{kang2018policy}), which allows imperfect expert policies in the beginning.
